<h3>Client-sided</h3>
| Pros ðŸ¤© | Cons ðŸ˜” |
| :--- | ---- |
| No extra software to download! | Another script to fetch when browser load... |
| It's cool! | It is... |

<h2 id="why">Why client-side?</h2>
Now you might be wondering; "But why would I ever want to transpile my Sass real-time?"

Well, good questionâ€¦ Think about it this way: Now you don't need to download any extra software, pre-processors or such!
Just link to the framework and it just works!

<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>
Alright, now when I've convinced you to use this, we can start talk about how to set it up and install it.

1. Go into your `<head>` tag and paste the following code:

```
<script src="https://rawcdn.githack.com/WilliamRagstad/RTS-Client/b54c77a47dd9fdd0798798b1f20239cd139cb32d/Transpiler/main.js"/>
```

2. Now **you're done**! Yeah, I know!

Create a new `<style>` tag and start write some Sass!
