<h2 id="about">About</h2>

Welcome to the RST Project.
This is a transpiler for Sass
written completely in JavaScript.

<h3>Client-sided</h3>
| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
| No downloads! | Another `<script>` to fetch on load. |
| Cool! | Yeah... |

<h2 id="why">Why transpile on client-side?</h2>

Now you might be wondering; "But why would I ever want to transpile my Sass real-time?"

Well, good question… Think about it this way: Now you don't need to download any extra software, pre-processors or such!
Just link to the framework and it just works!

<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>
Alright, now when I've convinced you to use this, we can start talk about how to set it up and install it.

Go into your `<head>` tag and paste the following code:

```
<script src="https://rawcdn.githack.com/WilliamRagstad/RTS-Client/b54c77a47dd9fdd0798798b1f20239cd139cb32d/Transpiler/main.js"/>
```

Now you're done! Yeah, I know!

Create a new `<style>` tag and start write Sass!

Then you just load up your website and look at your lovely new style!
